# Game Mechanics

You are the one who survived after fleeing your hometown — a name you’ve forgotten due to trauma. The only things you remember are the name Eirin and the taste of ash on your tongue. The village where you woke up is a border settlement on the edge of the Dark Forest, where scouts from the Flame Guild have recently been disappearing.

## Command Interface

- Explore – [E]: The system describes the area, NPCs, or hidden items.
- Combat – [F]: Initiates a fight; in combat, [A] attacks, [U] uses an item, [R] attempts to flee.
- Status and Inventory – [S]: Shows HP, “Sixth Sense,” and experience; [I] displays a list of items with usage limits.
- Navigation – [L] and [R]: Move the character through the area.
Help and Exit – [H]: Displays the help menu; [Q] ends the session.

**Control is carried out only using keys with an English layout!**

## Combat System

- Damage – simple integers; critical hits are rare and marked as “critical!”.
- Experience – defeating enemies grants XP; reaching threshold levels unlocks new abilities (e.g., Flame Touch, Shadow Step).
- Health Management – there is no automatic healing; the player must use potions, rest in safe areas, or rely on the “Sixth Sense” to avoid fatal blows.
